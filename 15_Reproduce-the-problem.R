# 15 - Reproduce the problem ----

# Before you seek outside help, strive to nail down your problem with this 
# level of rigor.

# - You can reliably induce it, whit minimal setup and fuss, to the point
#   where others can reproduce it.

# The "reprex" package is useful here.


# To give the user of your code insights on your current R session,
# use the "git2r" package from rOpenSci:
git2r::repository()
